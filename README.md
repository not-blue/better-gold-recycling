# Better Gold Recycling
Recycle more gold items! With this data pack, you can recycle more gold-based items, such as clocks and powered rails, in a furnace or blast furnace for nuggets or even ingots!

If something requires four or more ingots per item to make, get one ingot from smelting it. Otherwise, get a gold nugget. Exception: Clocks become nuggets.
